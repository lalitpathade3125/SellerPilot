"""Conversational Commerce Agent for SellerPilot AI.

Architectural Viva Notes:
1. Protocol Dependency Inversion: Adheres strictly to the CommerceService protocol.
   Receives InventoryService as an injected dependency, avoiding concrete coupling
   to Part B database ORM models or routes.
2. Zero Hallucination Guarantee: Product prices and stock levels are never generated
   from LLM memory; they are strictly retrieved via inventory.find_products() and
   inventory.get_stock().
3. Multi-tier Escalation Guard: Automatically triggers human escalation (escalate=True)
   with explicit reasons for:
   - Ambiguous queries without product references (e.g. "is this still available?")
   - Low classification confidence (< ESCALATION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
   - Bargaining / unapproved discount negotiations
   - Bulk and wholesale orders
   - Customer complaints, anger, damage reports, and refund requests
   - Bespoke customization inquiries
4. D2C Brand Persona: Maintains a warm, boutique artisan jewelry tone with tasteful
   emojis and helpful, proactive assistance.
