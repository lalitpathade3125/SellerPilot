# SellerPilot AI 🚀

SellerPilot AI is a multi-agent AI assistant designed for small, Instagram/WhatsApp-first Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) brands. Tailored for a synthetic handmade jewellery brand, SellerPilot coordinates specialized agents to handle conversational commerce, live inventory synchronization, and brand-voice content generation.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

SellerPilot AI employs a decoupled, multi-agent architecture coordinated via **LangGraph**:

1. **Conversational Commerce Agent (`/agents/commerce`)**:
   - Classifies customer intent (stock query, price query, shipping, other).
   - Inquires live catalog and stock via injected `InventoryService` protocols.
   - Responds in a warm, helpful seller voice.
   - Enforces human escalation for ambiguous queries, refund/custom requests, bargaining, or low model confidence.
2. **Inventory Sync Agent (`/agents/inventory`)**:
   - Manages live stock levels, reservations, and tracks low-stock/oversold alerts.
3. **Content Generation Agent (`/agents/content`)**:
   - Drafts on-brand Instagram captions and hashtags from product details and photos using brand voice guidelines.
4. **LangGraph Orchestrator (`/orchestrator`)**:
   - Central state graph that routes incoming events (`new_dm`, `new_product_photo`, `low_stock`) with explicit, loggable nodes and human escalation fallback.
5. **FastAPI Gateway (`/api`)**:
   - Provides `/webhook/message` for incoming Instagram and WhatsApp DMs, conversation query endpoints, and mounts inventory/content routes.
6. **Streamlit Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**:
   - Operational dashboard for sellers to monitor live chats, review inventory alerts, adjust stock, and trigger content drafts.

## 🔒 The Frozen Contract (`core/schemas.py`)
All communication across agents, services, and storage is validated through Pydantic v2 schemas defined in `core/schemas.py`. This contract is **frozen** to allow Person A and Person B to develop in parallel without breaking changes.

All inter-agent dependencies are injected via `typing.Protocol` interfaces defined in `core/interfaces.py`, ensuring zero concrete coupling across team ownership boundaries.

## 🛠️ Quickstart & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (tested on Python 3.11)
- Git

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShivamPathade14/SellerPilot.git
cd SellerPilot

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### Gemini Chat Responses

SellerPilot can use Gemini to write natural, context-aware commerce replies while inventory and order facts remain grounded in the existing agent. Create a Gemini API key in Google AI Studio and add it to your local `.env`:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
USE_GEMINI_FOR_COMMERCE=true
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash
```

Keep `USE_MOCKS=true` if you want mock inventory/content services; this setting does not disable Gemini chat replies. If no Gemini key is configured, the commerce agent falls back to its deterministic templates. The app does not track sales rankings or place orders, so it will not claim a bestseller or say an order was placed.

### 3. Running SellerPilot (Complete Quickstart)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Seed SQLite database with Aura Jewels catalog (15 products)
python scripts/seed_db.py

# 3. Launch the Streamlit Copilot Dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

### 4. Running the Multi-Agent Demos

#### Option A: Interactive Streamlit Demo (Visual Hackathon Flow)
Launch the dashboard (`streamlit run dashboard/app.py`), navigate to **🎬 Demo Mode** in the sidebar, and click **▶ Run End-to-End Demo**. The pipeline visually executes:
`Customer DM ──► LangGraph Orchestrator ──► Commerce Agent ──► Inventory Service ──► Grounded Response + Content Agent ──► Instagram Caption`

#### Option B: Standalone CLI Viva Demo (No Browser Required)
```bash
python scripts/demo_full.py
```

#### Option C: Inbound DM Simulator (Over HTTP or In-Process)
Simulate customer interactions across Instagram and WhatsApp channels:
```bash
python scripts/simulate_dm.py --all
```

### 5. Running the FastAPI Gateway
```bash
# Run FastAPI with live reload
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Interactive Swagger API documentation is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 6. Running the Automated Test Suite
```bash
# Run full suite (95 tests passing across Part A & Part B)
pytest -v
```

## 🎓 Key Architectural Decisions (Viva Defense)

1. **Protocol-Driven Dependency Inversion (`typing.Protocol`)**:
   - `CommerceService` and `Orchestrator` do not import concrete inventory or content implementations. They depend entirely on abstract protocols.
   - Allows Part A and Part B to be developed, mocked, and tested in total isolation.
2. **Deterministic Mock Service Fallback (`USE_MOCKS=true`)**:
   - `core/mocks.py` provides realistic synthetic data (~15 jewelry products) and functional mock services. Development, continuous integration, and test suites run reliably without external API costs or internet connectivity.
3. **Structured Outputs with Claude LLM**:
   - `core/llm.py` enforces schema guarantees using structured output / tool calling with Pydantic response models, preventing hallucinated response schemas.
4. **Stateful Graph Execution via LangGraph**:
   - LangGraph provides cyclic and stateful graph coordination, holding conversation context, catalog metadata, and routing decisions in a unified `SellerPilotState`.
5. **Guarded Route Ingestion**:
   - `api/main.py` conditionally mounts Part B routers (`routes_inventory.py`, `routes_content.py`), ensuring the API remains functional even if Part B routes have not yet been implemented.
